expansion-pack.js
================
Adding some useful (and others not so useful) functions to javascript's objects.

Why?
------------
It started as a challenge to implement some functions to the javascript Array and now we're implementing stuff all around. The only rule is to implement them as prototypes (this is an expansion pack after all). Accepting sugestions ans bits of code!

Installation:
------------
Just add the expansion-pack.js to your project and include it in your html.
```
<script src="path/to/expansion-pack.js"></script>
```

How to use it:
